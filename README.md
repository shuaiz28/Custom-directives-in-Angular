# Custom-directives-in-Angular
4 types of directives:

1. Element
2. Attribute
3. CSS class
4. Comment


Matching Directives:

1. Directives are markers on a DOM element.
2. Directives tell Angular's HTML compiler($compile) to attach a specified behavior to DOM elements.
3. The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to directives.

Directives Normalization:

- In .js, directives names are in camelCase(myDir).
- In .html, directives names are in lower-case < my-dir >< /my-dir > or < div my-dir >< /div >.
